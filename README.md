### Clustering

(A) Implement k-mean clustering with the objective function and learning rule from WA4-Q1.

(B) Plot the value of the objective function as a function of the iteration to show that the learning rule and implementation minimizes the following expression.

$$ D = \sum_{n=1}^N\sum{k=1}^N{r_{n,k} || x_n - \mu_k ||^2} $$

(C) Plot the results of the learning process by showing the initial, intermediate, and converged cluster centers overlaid on the data for $ k = 2 $ and $ k = 3 $.

(D) Devise a method to plot the decision boundaries for the dataset using the optimized parameters.

### Neural Networks

(A) Write a program to calculate the MSE of the data for a simple one-layer neural network using a sigmoid non-linearity.

(B) Compute the MSE for two different settings of the weights. Hand-select these weights to give large and small errors. Plot both boundaries on the dataset.

(C) Give a mathematical derivation of the gradient of the objective function with respect to the weights. Use $ w_0 $ to represent the bias term. Show and explain each step.

(D) Show how the gradient can be written in both scalar and vector form.

(E) Write code that computes the summed gradient for an ensemble of patterns. Illustrate the gradient by showing how the decision boundary changes for a small step.

## Work Log

1. Set up the project

    I created the basic file structure, created empty files, and read through the instructions.

2. Figure out what to do
